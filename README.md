# NUSvigate

NUSvigate is an android application that serves as an integrated platform that provides useful student-focused information to enhance students’ experience in NUS. This application brings about great convenience to students’ lives.

These are the main features of the application:

 GPS Campus Maps
1.1.  Name of location, estimated time to reach, estimated distance, the address of the location and the route to take to get to the destination
1.2. SBS Bus Arrival Time (NUS NextBus API was not working when this application was    implemented)
1.3. The application will seek permission from the user to be able to detect the geological location of the user for navigation purposes.
1.4. The different locations are found in different categories (e.g. Halls & Rc, lecture theatre) so that users can find where they want to go with ease. Map markers are not clustered as it makes it hard for the user to find the pins as the markers are all in NUS.

Lost & Found
  2.1. Person who found the item: upload the category of the item, where the item was found and the item description
  2.2. Person who lost the item: submit a request for a list of items using the category of the item and where the item was lost. A list of lost items will be returned including the email of the person who found the item would be provided for him or her to contact.
2.3. The application will seek permission from the user to be able to access the camera roll of the user.

Services Information
3.1. Information regarding accommodations (halls and RCs), payment of tuition fees, financial aid application and utility such as printing services are included in the application. Links to relevant web pages are provided as well.

Fixes
4.1. Students can make a report with the image of the faulty facility or property into the application, the faculty it is found in, the exact location and a description of it.

Latest NUS news and events
5.1 Students can view the latest news and events held in school in the application. Student leaders who wish to post events can email to the NUSvigate team.
